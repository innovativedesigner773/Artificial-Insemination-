# Quiz Integration with Course Creation

This document explains how the quiz system has been integrated into the course creation process, following the simplified Firestore data model you specified.

## ðŸ§© Firestore Data Structure

### Quiz Collection (`quizzes`)
```json
{
  "id": "quiz_123",
  "title": "HTML Basics Quiz",
  "description": "Test your HTML knowledge",
  "timeLimit": 300,  // in seconds
  "totalQuestions": 3,
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "courseId": "course_456" // optional reference
}
```

### Questions Collection (`questions`)
```json
{
  "id": "question_789",
  "text": "What does HTML stand for?",
  "options": [
    "Hyper Text Markup Language",
    "Home Tool Markup Language", 
    "Hyperlinks and Text Markup Language",
    "Hyper Tool Making Language"
  ],
  "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
  "explanation": "HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.",
  "points": 10,
  "imageUrl": null,
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "tags": ["HTML", "basics"],
  "quizId": "quiz_123"
}
```

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### 1. Course Creation with Quizzes

When creating a course, you can now add quiz lessons:

1. **Add Module**: Create a module for your course content
2. **Add Lesson**: Select "Assessment Quiz" as the lesson type
3. **Quiz Creator Opens**: A modal opens with the quiz creation interface
4. **Create Quiz**: 
   - Set quiz title, description, and time limit
   - Add questions with multiple choice options
   - Set correct answers by selecting the radio button
   - Add explanations, points, difficulty levels, and tags
5. **Quiz Linked**: The quiz is automatically linked to the lesson via `quizId`

### 2. Quiz Creation Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Add 2-6 options per question
- **Time Limits**: Set quiz duration in seconds (60-3600 seconds)
- **Scoring**: Assign points to each question
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Explanations**: Add optional explanations for correct answers
- **Tags**: Categorize questions with tags
- **Real-time Preview**: See all questions before creating the quiz

### 3. Quiz Taking Experience

Students can take quizzes through the `QuizInterface` component:

- **Timer**: Real-time countdown display
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and question navigation
- **Answer Selection**: Radio button interface for multiple choice
- **Question Navigation**: Jump between questions or go sequentially
- **Auto-submit**: Automatically submits when time runs out
- **Results Display**: Shows score, percentage, and pass/fail status

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Key Components

1. **QuizCreator**: Modal component for creating quizzes during course creation
2. **QuizInterface**: Component for students to take quizzes
3. **FirestoreService**: Database methods for quiz and question management
4. **CourseCreator**: Enhanced to support quiz lesson creation

### Database Methods

```typescript
// Create a new quiz
await firestoreService.createQuiz({
  title: "Quiz Title",
  description: "Quiz Description", 
  timeLimit: 300,
  courseId: "optional_course_id"
})

// Add questions to a quiz
await firestoreService.createQuestion(quizId, {
  text: "Question text",
  options: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
  correctAnswerIndex: 0,
  explanation: "Explanation text",
  points: 10,
  difficulty: "medium"
})

// Get quiz and questions
const quiz = await firestoreService.getQuiz(quizId)
const questions = await firestoreService.getQuestions(quizId)

// Submit quiz answers
const result = await firestoreService.submitQuiz(quizId, answers, timeSpent)
```

### Lesson Integration

Quiz lessons are stored in the course modules with a `quizId` reference:

```typescript
interface Lesson {
  id: string
  title: string
  type: 'quiz'
  duration: number
  content?: string
  quizId?: string // Links to the quiz document
}
```
